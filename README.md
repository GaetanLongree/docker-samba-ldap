# docker-samba-ldap
Docker container with openLDAP preconfiguration

This container is not yet functional with LDAP (for unknown reasons, suggestions welcome).

Contains the Crypt-SmbHash scrip mentionned in this [guide](https://spredzy.wordpress.com/2013/08/30/samba-standalone-openldap/)

I will redact a more indepth README once I'm over with finals, thanks for understanding.
